# Scsi50F-to-IDC26

Little adapter to use 50pin male devices with 13x2 scsi hosts. Not too much to say, just a little PCB to connect 50 male scsi devices to 13x6 (26) idc hosts adapters, like Blizzard SCSI module for example.

# Pinout

From the 50 pin connector to the 26 pin connector.

(50 Female) 2 - 50 Signals to (26 IDC Male) 1 - 25 signals.

(50 Female) 1-49 GND

(26 IDC Male) 26 not connected.

# Note

This is a work in progress, several testing must be made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
